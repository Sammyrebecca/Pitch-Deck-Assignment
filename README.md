This guide corresponds to the slide numbers in the main presentation file.

Slide 1: Cover Slide
Title: RehabAI Kenya – Smarter Recovery for All

Tagline: AI-driven rehabilitation, affordable and accessible.

Visual: Ensure the logo is high-resolution. The background image should be professional, modern, and evoke healthcare and technology in a Kenyan context.

Presenter Note: Start with a strong, confident opening that states your mission.

Slide 2: The Problem
Focus: Emphasize the scale and human impact of the problem. The statistics here are critical.

Visual: Use a poignant, high-quality image that tells the story of inaccessibility (e.g., a long road, a crowded clinic waiting room).

Presenter Note: Speak to the economic burden and the emotional toll on families. Make it relatable.

Slide 3: The Opportunity
Focus: Shift the narrative from problem to potential. Highlight the enabling factors.

Visual: Use modern, optimistic icons (smartphones, growth charts, government logos) to visually represent digitization and growth.

Presenter Note: Position RehabAI as the natural solution emerging from these favorable conditions.

Slide 4: Our Solution
Focus: Be clear and concise. The checkmarks (✅) make it easily scannable.

Visual: The app mockup is crucial. If possible, use a short video/GIF in the live presentation to demonstrate the AI motion tracking.

Presenter Note: Briefly explain how "AI motion tracking" works in simple terms (e.g., "Our software uses your phone's camera like a personal trainer, watching your movements and providing guidance").

Slide 5: How It Works
Focus: Simplify the complex technology into an easy-to-follow user journey.

Visual: The flowchart is key. Keep it visually simple and uncluttered.

Presenter Note: Walk through each step calmly. This slide proves the solution is practical and well-designed.

Slide 6: Benefits
Focus: Clearly articulate the value proposition for each key stakeholder.

Visual: The three-column layout is effective. Use icons to make it visually engaging.

Presenter Note: Tailor your emphasis based on your audience (e.g., talk more about clinician benefits with hospitals, patient benefits with NGOs).

Slide 7: Market Size
Focus: Establish the commercial viability and growth potential of the venture.

Visual: The map with callouts is excellent. Ensure the numbers are large and bold.

Presenter Note: Be prepared to answer questions on how you calculated these figures.

Slide 8: Business Model
Focus: Demonstrate a clear path to revenue. The multi-channel approach is a strength.

Visual: The three-pillar visual effectively shows diversified revenue streams.

Presenter Note: Highlight the leverage of existing infrastructure like M-Pesa, which reduces friction for users.

Slide 9: Competitive Advantage
Focus: This is your "unfair advantage." Be confident and specific about what makes you different and better.

Visual: The quadrant visual is perfect for displaying multiple strengths.

Presenter Note: Practice stating these advantages succinctly. This is a core part of your investment thesis.

Slide 10: Go-to-Market Strategy
Focus: Show that you have a realistic, phased plan for growth, not just ambition.

Visual: The timeline graphic should be clean and direct.

Presenter Note: Mention any existing conversations or soft commitments you have for Phase 1 pilots.

Slide 11: The Team
Focus: Investors bet on the team. Show why your team is the right one to execute this vision.

Visual: Use professional headshots. Include logos of past reputable employers or universities for credibility.

Presenter Note: Have each team member briefly state their role and why they are passionate about this problem.

Slide 12: Impact (SDGs)
Focus: Appeal to the "double bottom line" (financial and social returns) that many modern investors seek.

Visual: Use the official UN SDG icons for professionalism and recognition.

Presenter Note: Connect each SDG directly back to your product's function (e.g., "By providing affordable rehab, we directly contribute to Reduced Inequalities - SDG 10").

Slide 13: Financial Projections
Focus: Show ambitious but realistic growth. The numbers should tell a logical story.

Visual: A simple bar or line chart is best. Avoid complex spreadsheets on the slide.

Presenter Note: Be prepared to defend your assumptions in the Q&A. Have a detailed financial model ready to share upon request.

Slide 14: Our Ask
Focus: Be explicit and direct. Clearly state what you need and how it will be used.

Visual: The pie chart is a clear and trusted way to visualize fund allocation.

Presenter Note: This is your call to action. Deliver it with conviction. "We are seeking $1.5M in seed funding to..."

Slide 15: Thank You / Vision
Focus: End on a memorable, visionary, and human note.

Visual: The final image should be uplifting and positive.

Presenter Note: Reiterate the vision passionately. State your contact information clearly. Open the floor for questions.
